# Crisp: AI Interview Assistant

Crisp is a modern, AI-powered web application designed to streamline the technical screening process. It provides an automated, chat-based interview experience for candidates and a comprehensive dashboard for interviewers to review the results.

## How It Helps

Crisp acts as an intelligent partner for both hiring managers and candidates:

*   **For Interviewers:**
    *   **Automate Screening:** Offload the initial, repetitive screening interviews to a capable AI.
    *   **Ensure Consistency:** Every candidate gets a standardized interview experience with unbiased, AI-driven evaluations.
    *   **Save Time:** Quickly review high-level summaries and scores on the dashboard, and dive into transcripts only when needed.
    *   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Make informed decisions with detailed feedback, scores for each question, and an overall performance summary.

*   **For Candidates:**
    *   **Flexible & Accessible:** Take the interview at a time that works for them, right from their browser.
    *   **Clear & Focused:** Engage in a straightforward, timed Q&A format that tests their knowledge effectively.
    *   **Practice Opportunity:** Provides a low-pressure way to experience a technical interview format.

2. Run dev server:
   npm run dev
3. Open the app at: http://localhost:3000

Environment / API key
- The app uses the Google Gemini SDK. Provide your Gemini API key via environment during local development.
- For the local dev server (Vite), the key is wired through `process.env.API_KEY` in the config. Do not commit secrets to source control.

Security & privacy
- All candidate data (resumes, chat history, scores) is persisted in browser localStorage only.
