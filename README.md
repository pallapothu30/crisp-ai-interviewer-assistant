# Crisp: AI Interview Assistant

Crisp is a modern, AI-powered web application designed to streamline the technical screening process. It provides an automated, chat-based interview experience for candidates and a comprehensive dashboard for interviewers to review the results.

## How It Helps

Crisp acts as an intelligent partner for both hiring managers and candidates:

*   **For Interviewers:**
    *   **Automate Screening:** Offload the initial, repetitive screening interviews to a capable AI.
    *   **Ensure Consistency:** Every candidate gets a standardized interview experience with unbiased, AI-driven evaluations.
    *   **Save Time:** Quickly review high-level summaries and scores on the dashboard, and dive into transcripts only when needed.
    *   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Make informed decisions with detailed feedback, scores for each question, and an overall performance summary.

*   **For Candidates:**
    *   **Flexible & Accessible:** Take the interview at a time that works for them, right from their browser.
    *   **Clear & Focused:** Engage in a straightforward, timed Q&A format that tests their knowledge effectively.
    *   **Practice Opportunity:** Provides a low-pressure way to experience a technical interview format.

## Key Features

*   üìÑ **AI Resume Parsing:** Upload a PDF or DOCX resume, and Crisp automatically extracts key information like name, email, and phone number.
*   ü§ñ **Dynamic Question Generation:** The AI generates relevant technical questions for a full-stack (React/Node.js) role, with varying difficulty levels based on a predefined interview flow.
*   üíØ **Automated Scoring & Feedback:** Candidate answers are evaluated in real-time, providing a score (0-100) and constructive feedback on correctness, clarity, and depth.
*   üìä **Comprehensive Interviewer Dashboard:** A central hub to view all completed interviews. You can search, sort by date, name, or score, and view detailed reports.
*   ‚è±Ô∏è **Timed Responses:** Each question is timed to simulate real-world interview pressure and assess a candidate's ability to think on their feet.
*   üí¨ **Interactive Chat UI:** A clean, modern, and intuitive chat interface for the candidate experience.
*   üíæ **Local Data Persistence:** All candidate and interview data is stored securely in the browser's `localStorage`. No backend or database is required.
*   ‚Ü©Ô∏è **Session Resumption:** If a candidate closes the tab or their browser crashes, they can seamlessly resume an interview in progress.

## How to Set Up

This is a frontend-only application that runs entirely in the browser.

1.  **Get a Gemini API Key:**
    *   The application uses the Google Gemini API for its AI capabilities.
    *   You need to obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

2.  **Set Up Environment Variable:**
    *   The application is configured to read the API key from `process.env.API_KEY`.
    *   **Important:** Since this project is provided as a set of static files, there's no build process to inject environment variables. For local testing, you may need to temporarily replace `process.env.API_KEY` in `services/geminiService.ts` with your actual key string. Remember to **never** commit API keys directly into your code.

3.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Serve the `index.html` file using a local web server. If you have Node.js, you can use a simple package like `http-server`:
        ```bash
        npx http-server .
        ```
    *   Open your browser and navigate to the local server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

That's it! You can now start using the AI Interview Assistant.
